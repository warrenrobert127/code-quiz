# code-quiz

This project is a Javascript quiz that I created ussing CSS, Javascript, and HTML. The criteria that was followed is the one provided in the module along with the acceptance criteria.

The app ask the user questions, tells the player whether or not the answer that was provided is right/wrong. The app keeps the users score, it subtracts points from a score for incottect answers, and displays users high score with their initials.
